## Assignment Overview

This assignment involves implementing a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the **fleet management problem**, where the goal is to optimize the routes for delivery vehicles in a city. The optimization aims to minimize the total distance traveled by the fleet while ensuring each delivery node in the city is visited exactly once by any vehicle.

### Key Concepts

1. **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: A search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection, used to solve optimization and search problems. It works by evolving a population of candidate solutions through iterations using selection, crossover, and mutation.

2. **Fleet Management Problem**: The task involves optimizing the routes for a fleet of delivery vehicles in a city, minimizing the total distance traveled while ensuring that each delivery location (node) is visited once. The problem is a variation of the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**.

### Assignment Breakdown

This assignment is divided into several parts:

1. **Part 1: Single Vehicle Optimization**
   - You start by optimizing the route for a **single vehicle** that needs to visit all nodes in the city.
   - The vehicle starts and ends at the depot (node 0).
   - The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by the vehicle.
   - The city is represented as a graph, where each node corresponds to a delivery location, and the distances between the nodes are provided in a distance matrix (`city_distances.csv`).

2. **Part 2: Genetic Algorithm**
   - You implement a genetic algorithm to solve this optimization problem.
   - The genetic algorithm includes the following components:
     - **Population Initialization**: Create an initial population of routes (solutions).
     - **Fitness Evaluation**: Calculate the fitness of each solution (route) based on the total distance traveled. The fitness function is designed to minimize the distance.
     - **Selection**: Select individuals for crossover based on their fitness using **tournament selection**.
     - **Crossover**: Perform **order crossover (OX)** to combine the genetic material of two parent routes and create offspring.
     - **Mutation**: Apply **mutation** to introduce random changes in the offspring.
     - **Termination Condition**: The algorithm runs until a predefined number of generations or until an acceptable solution is found.
     - **output**:
     - Best Solution: [0, 20, 18, 27, 1, 19, 6, 25, 15, 3, 8, 16, 10, 26, 22, 29, 12, 7, 28, 23, 24, 2, 30, 9, 4, 14, 31, 13, 5, 11, 17, 21]
     - Total Distance: -1000000.0
     - Total time: 0.038
3. **Part 3: Parallelization**
   - Once the sequential version of the genetic algorithm is working, you need to parallelize the algorithm to run over multiple machines or processes.
   - Parallelization is implemented using **MPI4PY** (Message Passing Interface for Python).
   - The goal is to distribute the population across multiple processes and parallelize the fitness calculation, selection, and other operations.
   - **output**:
   - Generation 100 took 0.00 seconds.
   - Total time: 0.003048419952392578
   - Final Best Route: [0, 65, 68, 33, 84, 1, 88, 34, 16, 11, 56, 45, 9, 97, 96, 46, 90, 67, 53, 8, 63, 94, 73, 47, 44, 60, 83, 95, 57, 54, 75, 74, 82, 69, 23, 52, 12, 58, 32, 62, 86, 92, 7, 25, 77, 29, 41, 71, 43, 78, 17, 42, 59, 2, 79, 50, 91, 24, 80, 99, 70, 36, 87, 55, 20, 35, 49, 39, 13, 66, 4, 93, 15, 28, 72, 10, 19, 89, 14, 40, 38, 26, 31, 21, 3, 48, 85, 22, 5, 76, 30, 37, 51, 18, 27, 81, 61, 98, 64, 6]

4. **Part 4: Enhancements**
   - After parallelizing the genetic algorithm, you need to improve it further by:
     - Distributing the algorithm across multiple machines.
     - Enhancing the algorithm's performance and comparing the results before and after the improvements.

5. **Part 5: Large-Scale Problem**
   - You are tasked with running the algorithm on an extended city map with more nodes (100 nodes instead of 20).
   - The extended map introduces a more complex problem with more possible routes.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language used to implement the genetic algorithm.
- **MPI4PY**: The Python library used to parallelize the algorithm over multiple processes or machines using the Message Passing Interface (MPI).
- **NumPy**: A fundamental library used for handling arrays and matrices, including the distance matrix for the city map.
- **CSV**: Used to load the city distance data from a file (`city_distances.csv`).
- **Genetic Algorithm Components**:
  - **Population**: A set of potential solutions represented as routes.
  - **Fitness Function**: A function to evaluate the quality of each route by calculating the total distance.
  - **Selection**: A method to select individuals for reproduction based on fitness.
  - **Crossover**: A method to combine two parent routes to generate offspring.
  - **Mutation**: A method to randomly alter a route to introduce diversity in the population.

## Detailed Algorithm Steps

### 1. **Population Initialization**
   - Initialize a population of routes where each route is a permutation of the delivery nodes (excluding the depot node).
   - The first node (depot) is fixed in all routes, and the remaining nodes are permuted randomly.

### 2. **Fitness Calculation**
   - The fitness function calculates the total distance traveled by a vehicle based on its route.
   - The distance matrix is used to calculate the distance between consecutive nodes in the route.
   - A large penalty is applied if an infeasible route is encountered (i.e., if two nodes are disconnected).

### 3. **Selection (Tournament Selection)**
   - In tournament selection, a subset of individuals (routes) is randomly selected, and the individual with the highest fitness is chosen as a parent for reproduction.
   - This process is repeated for multiple tournaments to select a pool of parents for crossover.

### 4. **Crossover (Order Crossover)**
   - Order Crossover (OX) combines two parent routes to produce two offspring.
   - A random segment from one parent is copied to the offspring, and the remaining positions are filled with the nodes from the other parent while preserving their relative order.

### 5. **Mutation**
   - Mutation randomly swaps two nodes in a route with a low probability (mutation rate). This introduces small changes to the solution to help explore different parts of the solution space.

### 6. **Termination Condition**
   - The algorithm continues for a predefined number of generations or until an optimal solution (or acceptable fitness) is reached.

## Parallelization with MPI4PY

### 1. **Distribute Population**
   - The population is divided into subpopulations, which are distributed across different MPI processes.
   - Each process calculates the fitness for its assigned individuals.

### 2. **Collect Results**
   - The fitness values for all individuals in the population are gathered and exchanged between processes using MPI communication.
   - The global best solution is determined by comparing the fitness values from all processes.

### 3. **Parallel Selection, Crossover, and Mutation**
   - Selection, crossover, and mutation operations can also be parallelized by applying them independently to subgroups of the population.
   - This reduces the overall execution time by performing these operations simultaneously on multiple processes.

### 4. **Performance Metrics**
   - After parallelizing the algorithm, you can compare the execution time before and after the enhancements to evaluate the performance improvement.

## Running the Algorithm

1. **Initialization**: The initial population is generated randomly using `generate_unique_population`.
2. **Fitness Evaluation**: Fitness values are calculated for each individual in the population.
3. **Selection**: Individuals are selected for reproduction based on their fitness.
4. **Crossover and Mutation**: New offspring are created using crossover and mutation operations.
5. **Termination**: The algorithm stops after a predefined number of generations or when an acceptable solution is found.

## Enhancements and Improvements

- **Parallelization**: By distributing the population and fitness evaluations across multiple processes, the algorithm can handle larger populations and reduce computation time.
- **Scaling**: As the city size increases (e.g., from 20 nodes to 100 nodes), the parallelized algorithm becomes essential to maintain reasonable computation times.

---

## Challenges

- **Infeasible Routes**: Handling disconnected nodes (routes that cannot be traveled directly between two nodes) requires proper penalty handling in the fitness function.
- **Parallelization**: Efficiently distributing tasks and handling communication between processes is challenging, but crucial for improving performance on large-scale problems.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Multiple Cars**: The algorithm can be extended to handle multiple delivery vehicles. This would involve assigning routes to multiple vehicles and ensuring each node is visited exactly once by one vehicle.
- **Dynamic Population Adjustment**: The algorithm can be enhanced by dynamically adjusting the population size or mutation rates based on the progress of the solution.
- **Hybrid Algorithms**: Combining genetic algorithms with other optimization techniques like simulated annealing or local search could further improve performance.
